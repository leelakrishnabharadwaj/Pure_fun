# Pure_fun
A fun time project apart from being software engineer(P.S : Not to forget things)

Day -1 :
Decided the techstack : Java - Spring Boot in back end, Angular in front end. 
Created a template for the project 
Note : Still not decide what to do......lol
Day -2 : Added all the back end code required for login page 
Day -3 : Talked with Aravind sai and he is working on UI design which i need to translate into angular 
Day -4 : I realised its a long back since i used angular and so to brush my sills i will add anothe angular app and practice in it for a day or 2 and then start work on project.
